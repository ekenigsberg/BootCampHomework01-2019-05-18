Errors in the homework instructions:

<b>1) "use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts."</b><br/>
we did "Text to Columns" in class, but not functions like LEFT(), FIND(), and MID()

<b>2) "filters based on parent category"</b><br/>
there's no field named "parent category"
  
I know Excel & VBA very well so I'm eager to get to Python, but this was still a fun assignment.
