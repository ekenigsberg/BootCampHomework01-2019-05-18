Errors in the homework instructions:

1) "use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts."
   we did "Text to Columns" in class, but not functions like LEFT(), FIND(), and MID()

2) "filters based on parent category"
   there's no field named "parent category"
  
I know Excel & VBA very well so I'm eager to get to Python, but this was still a fun assignment.
